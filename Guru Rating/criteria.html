    <h1>Criteria</h1>

    <ul>
      <li><span>One star: </span></br>If a guru has been involved in any sexual affairs with students, has abused or manipulated them, he immediately gets 1 star.</li>
      <li><span>Two stars: </span></br>There are possible signs that a guru has done any of the above but no conclusive evidence.
                                 There are always people who dislike a guru and may try to disgrace him even if he is actually genuine.
                                 But if there is a lot of drama in a community such as ex members who say the guru mistreated them, strange stories
                                 or members who were excommunicated, this is a red flag.</li>
      <li><span>Three stars: </span></br>If ...</li>
      <li><span>Four stars: </span></br>Good guru, but some possible signs of being commercial.</li>
      <li><span>Five stars: </span></br>No sign of: 1) Commercial interests <br>
                                                    2) Sexual affairs (with students) <br>
                                                    If any such actions become known, it may go from 5 stars to 1 star.</li>
